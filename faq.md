## Assignments 
### Question

### What will the homework consist of? Do I need to know how to code or do statistics?
[](The problem sets will be a mix of discussion questions (e.g., is it ethical to use neural prosthetics to enhance cognition?) and technical questions (e.g., please calculate the time delay between neural signal A and neural signal B reaching the brain). You do **not** need to know how to code or do statistics, but you will at times need to perform basic calculations from formulas that we will teach and explain. Everything you need to know to complete the psets will be covered in lecture or section.)

### Do I have to write a paper for the final?
[](The final paper is an oppourtunity to explore a topic from the course in more depth. You can either write a "review" paper summarizing a subtopic discussed in the course, or write an "opinion" paper arguing a side of a debate (e.g., is it ethical to track people's browsing data?). However, individuals with a creative idea may elect to do a project instead of writing a paper. For example, you may choose to survey people's level of comfort with AI tracking their personal data, and then analyze and report the survey data. For those who are technically inclined, you could come up with a coding project that uses neural networks to generate music or art. Creativity is encouraged!

**All students** (whether writing a paper or doing a project) will have to get their idea approved by the professor / their section TF beforehand. More details about the assignment will be given at a later date.)

### Can I turn in my assignment late and still get credit?
[](The late policy says that you get 1 "free pass" for a late assignment (up to 2 days). After that, any late assignment will get 1 point deducted for every day that it is late. For example, if the homework is due Friday and you turn it in on Monday, you will be deducted 3 points from your final score. Remember, each pset is worth a total of 10 points. The latest you can turn a homework in and still recieve credit (with the late penalties) is the Wednesday after the pset is due @ 11:59PM.)

## General / Course Logistics
### Who should take this course?

### What if I have a serious reason that I can't attend class / section?
[](Life happens! Since lectures will be recorded, you can access and watch class content at a later date. We will also offer extensions on psets, making sure that you have enough time to recover and complete assignments. If you will also be missing section, you can either ask your TF to record section or provide you with the material afterwards. If you happen to be asymptomatic or feeling well enough to participate in section, you can ask your TF to Zoom into section, if possible.]

### Where can I get extra help outside of section?
Prof. Lai will host weekly office hours after class on Mondays and Wednesdays, until around 7pm PDT.
