Hi! I'm your Head Teaching Fellow, which means I'm in charge of all things course-organization related. I'm a 4th year PhD student in the Neuroscience program, and my research focuses on how humans learn and make decisions under limited cognitive resources. You can come to me for questions and/or complaints about the course website, problem set design, etc. For all grading inquires, please go to your section TFs.
