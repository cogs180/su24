Hi! I’m a 3rd year PhD student in the Biophysics program. I’m broadly interested in theoretically understanding how machine learning works and its relation to the brain. My research focuses on using tools from statistical physics to study the properties of the learned connectivities in artificial neural networks and to infer neural circuit structure using behavioral and neuronal data in animals. You can come to me for questions about grading, contents covered in class/sections, or for any general discussions about the field.
