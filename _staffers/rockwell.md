Hi! My name is Rockwell. I currently a 5th year graduate student in the MCO program and I study the evolution and ontogeny of animal behavior using mice as a model organism. To study how behavior evolves, I look at how behavioral phenotypes are distributed across species of deer mice and apply statistical and phylogenetic tools to infer how and why members of this clade are so different. To study the ontogeny of behavior, I track how the behavior of lab mice develops as they age. Both projects require me to observe animal behavior, and machine learning allows me to quantitatively describe what I observe! I'm excited to meet everyone this semester as we embark on our AI journey! And lastly, I'm happy to chat about projects, grad school, and anything under the sun.
