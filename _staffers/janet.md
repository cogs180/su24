Hi! I’m Janet, your TA for COGS 180 this session. I’m currently a PhD student here at the Cognitive Science department at UCSD. I work in Professor Doug Nitz’s lab, where my research focuses in taking a systems neuroscience approach towards investigating navigation and spatial cognition using electrophysiological techniques to record single neurons and local field potentials in rats while they perform tasks and run through mazes. When I’m not doing that, I love being  outdoors – climbing, hiking, biking, swimming, exploring canyons, rivers, and so on. I’m looking forward to being your TA this summer!
