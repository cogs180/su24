Hi, I will be your course instructor for Cogs 180! I am incredibly passionate about teaching have 8 years experience in teaching both undergraduate and graduate courses at Rice University and Harvard. I recieved my Ph.D. from Harvard in May 2024, where I studied "resource-rational" decision making (or, how people make decisions with limited cognitive resources). My research employs computational modeling (information theory, bayesian statistics, reinforcement learning) to understand human behavior, from learning and decision making to the psychology of beliefs. I am very excited to revive this course this summer, and to learn together with you all about this fasicating topic which is pertinent to our everyday lives. I always welcome feedback, so please don't hesitate to be in touch.
