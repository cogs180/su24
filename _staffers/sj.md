Hi! I am an MD-PhD student in the last year in medical school (with Program in Neuroscience). My PhD research focused on the neural mechanism behind dopamine dependent learning. I am happy to chat about questions regarding class or section materials, life as a graduate student, or basic neuroscience in general.
